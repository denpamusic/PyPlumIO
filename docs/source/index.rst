Welcome to PyPlumIO's documentation!
====================================

The `PyPlumIO <https://github.com/denpamusic/PyPlumIO/>`_ projects aims to
provide complete and easy to use solution for communicating with
climate devices manufactured by `Plum Sp. z o.o. <https://www.plum.pl/>`_

Currently it supports reading and writing parameters of ecoMAX controllers by
Plum Sp. z o.o., getting service password and sending network information to
show on controller's display.

Devices can be connected directly via RS-485 to USB adapter or through network by using
RS-485 to Ethernet/WiFi converter.

Quickstart
==========
1. To use PyPlumIO, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    (.venv) $ pip install pyplumio

2. Connect to the ecoMAX controller:

>>> connection = pyplumio.open_serial_connection("/dev/ttyUSB0")
>>> await connection.connect()
>>> ecomax = await connection.get("ecomax")

3. Print some values:

>>> print(await ecomax.get("heating_temp"))

4. Don't forget to close the connection:

>>> await connection.close()
